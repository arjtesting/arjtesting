This congregation maintains a consistent practice of being regularly informed of the actions and plans in which we are all expected to participate. Before the elders can know in which direction to lead, they must make plans with meetings that include the preacher, deacons, teachers, and the other members, as we all play a part in the growth of the church.

Few matters and in-depth plans can be worked out to move the church ahead without serious discussion, information and feed-back. Having too much information holds a fonder position than “nobody mentioned that before”. “I’ve already heard that at previous congregational meetings” lacks regard for other members that are new or maybe didn’t realize what was presented and are still expected to participate.

Lest there be any confusion, this is not a congregational business meeting. It would be unscriptural to make this a decision making meeting. (Acts 14:23; Tit. 1:5, 1 Tim. 3:2,4; 1 Cor. 14:34-35) But, it is an updating and information providing meeting of what has been decided or about to be started that is good for the congregation and from the congregation.

As elders we must use every opportunity to stimulate the spirit and growth of the church, by initiating teaching, preaching and training programs, and even changes in the order of worship. Sometimes the decisions made might make some uncomfortable but our love for them and their soul is our main focus. The long range effects of the seemingly small variations of our behavior cause firm decisions now to keep the flock from straying and protect it from predators that will seize every opportunity to weaken and destroy it.

The good work of all its members makes for a strong congregation that is informed of the “overall plan” of heaven as our goal.
