For the safety of our church family and our community, we are complying with local orders not to gather in large groups. We hope to be back together soon. In the meantime, we are gathering online.

We are live-streaming the weekly sermon on [our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0kUKcP_9v4_WfhyDAN5DOg) at 10am Central on Sundays. Previous sermons are also available there. For Bible study, we are meeting on Zoom. Please contact us for more information.
